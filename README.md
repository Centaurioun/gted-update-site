# Unofficial update site for the GTED Eclipse plugin

The [GTED Eclipse plugin](https://github.com/simasch/gted) is an editor for GNU gettext internalization files. This update site is provided as a hopefully temporary substitute for the official www.gted.org site, which has been unavailable for quite some time. It is provided without any guarantee whatsoever, on a pure "works for me" basis.
It was obtained from an existing Eclipse installation, but it should match what you would get by cloning and building the original repository.
