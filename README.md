# Unofficial update site for the GTED Eclipse plugin

The [GTED Eclipse plugin](https://github.com/simasch/gted) is an editor for GNU gettext internalization files. This update site is provided as a hopefully temporary substitute for the official www.gted.org site, which has been unavailable for quite some time. It is provided without any guarantee whatsoever, on a pure "works for me" basis.

The actual site is available at https://nmusatti.github.io/gted-update-site/ .

It was obtained from an existing Eclipse installation, but it should match what you would get by cloning and building the original repository. This version of GTED should work with all the Eclipse releases listed on the [Eclipse Marketplace](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/gted-gettext-editor), but it was only tested with Oxygen (4.7) and 2018-09 (4.9).
