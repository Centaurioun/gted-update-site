# Unofficial update site for the GTED Eclipse plugin

The [GTED Eclipse plugin](https://github.com/simasch/gted) is an editor for GNU gettext internalization files. This update site is provided as a hopefully temporary substitute for the official www.gted.org site, which has been unavailable for quite some time.
